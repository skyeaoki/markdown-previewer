I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

### User Story #3: 
When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

### User Story #4: 
When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type.

### User Story #5: 
When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

### User Story #6:

#### Optional Bonus: 
My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
